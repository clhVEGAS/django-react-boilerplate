# django-react-boilerplate

This is going to be a boilerplate application with CRUD and admin capabilities over the back end from the front end.

Currently features a react UI made with create-react-app that uses fetch functions to retrieve and display data that get be added, updated, and deleted from a sqlite3 DB.
Backend is make in Django and features CRUD capabilites. Will be developing that more as time goes on and documenting the API and everything that can be done with this later,
this is just the filler text for my initial upload.
